 <h2>Managed versus detached JPA entities</h2>
 
 One cool thing about "managed entities" is that application code can
 mutate the state of a managed entity and rest assured that all changes will
 be saved to the database sooner or later (there are exceptions to this rule
 as will be demonstrated by tests in this package<sup>1</sup>). The
 application need not bother about the underlying JDBC connection or know how
 to issue SQL statements for the updates to take effect.<p>
 
 One optimization that many persistence providers can do when loading an
 entity from the database, is to fetch some parts, or state, of the entity
 "lazily". Doing so means loading the state only upon first being requested
 (traversed). For many applications, this saves a few database round trips.<p>
 
 On the other hand, some state is "eagerly" fetched/loaded. Eager data loading
 is a requirement for all <code>@Basic</code> fields (the default for a "basic"
 field if it is left unannotated) and fields that represent "single-valued"
 associations with other entities (<code>@OneToOne</code>, <code>@ManyToOne</code>).<p>
 
 Lazy data loading, whether by default or set by the application, is only a
 hint to the provider who may ignore the hint and do eager loading instead.
 On the other hand, whenever eager loading has been configured, then the
 provider must honor and use this strategy. Some stuff that by default is
 eagerly fetched was listed in the last paragraph. Other things such as
 multi-valued associations (<code>@OneToMany</code>, <code>@ManyToMany</code>) and
 collections of basic java types (<code>@ElementCollection</code>) may be fetched
 lazily, and that is what many providers actually do. Which leads me to the
 second great thing about "managed entities"!<p>
 
 Even though the entity state might not have been fully fetched from the
 database, application code can always traverse a managed entity and the state
 will seamlessly be fetched by the provider working in the background.
 Awesome!<p>
 
 Freely mutating state and be safe knowing it will actually be saved to the
 database, is only a benefit that managed entities has. Of course, you may
 mutate the state of a detached entity (one that is not managed), but the
 changes will not be saved. A detached entity is most likely no more than a
 stupid POJO (Plain Old Java Object) with no extra magic attached.<p>
 
 Traversing a not fully loaded state is always safe to do with managed
 entities. It is most likely not that safe to traverse the state of a detached
 entity. The provider is not forbidden by the specification to honor such
 traversals, but the providers seldom do.<p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Persistence Context and the Entity Manager</h2>
 
 Section "7.1 Persistence Contexts":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     A persistence context is a set of managed entity instances in which for
     any persistent entity identity there is a unique entity instance. Within
     the persistence context, the entity instances and their lifecycle are
     managed by the entity manager.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 The persistence context is "a set of managed entity instances". Awesome. The
 <code>EntityManager</code> is the application code's interface for access to the
 persistence context and the interface has also methods for creating
 queries.<p>
 
 Entity manager and persistence context are two different things.<p>
 
 But, from a logical viewpoint, the entity manager can be viewed as <i>the</i>
 persistence context. Entity managers and their persistence context are so
 tightly coupled that Java EE code often inject an entity manager using the
 annotation "<code>@PersistenceContext</code>".<p>
 
 To illustrate the tight coupling, here's the JavaDoc of <code>EntityManager.contains(Object)</code>:
 
 <pre><code>
 
     Check if the instance is a managed entity instance belonging to the
     current persistence context.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 The tight coupling will inevitably lead to a language used where the
 terminology "persistence context" and "entity manager" are used pseudo
 randomly. Such is the case for all "hello world" samples the Internet
 provide. Unfortunately, sometimes it is also the case for Java EE
 specifications. This blur translates to a tuff challenge when trying to
 understand the difference and exact nature of entity managers and persistence
 contexts. In this file and all related ones, I'll try my best to separate the
 two as far as possible and as far as my understanding serves me right.<p>
 
 What we do know for sure and what probably is the most important point, is
 that a "persistence context" is something the entity manager has a reference
 to. The persistence context is "an invisible cloud" where managed entities
 live.<p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Container-managed versus application-managed entity managers</h2>
 
 Street language often speak of a multitude of different "types" of entity
 managers. But, there are no different types of entity managers. However, we
 do say there exists different types of a persistence context. We will return
 to persistence context types a bit later.<p>
 
 Just like <code>@Singleton</code> threading<sup>2</sup> and JTA transaction
 demarcation<sup>3</sup>, the entity manager too can opt for <i>management</i>
 by the container or by the application. If I manage my own monetary funds or
 if I let an incompetent fund manager do that for me, is not the same as
 having different "types" of money. The money remains the same.<p>
 
 Okay, "managed" is a bit of a saturated word in our line of business. In JPA,
 what is "managed" is the life cycle of the entity manager, life cycle of the
 persistence context involved and how a persistence context propagate to a
 container-managed entity manager.<p>
 
 Section "7.1 Persistence Contexts":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     In Java EE environments, a JTA transaction typically involves calls
     across multiple components. Such components may often need to access the
     same persistence context within a single transaction. To facilitate such
     use of entity managers in Java EE environments, when an entity manager is
     injected into a component or looked up directly in the JNDI naming
     context, its persistence context will automatically be propagated with
     the current JTA transaction, and the EntityManager references that are
     mapped to the same persistence unit will provide access to this same
     persistence context within the JTA transaction. This propagation of
     persistence contexts by the Java EE container avoids the need for the
     application to pass references to EntityManager instances from one
     component to another. An entity manager for which the container manages
     the persistence context in this manner is termed a container-managed
     entity manager. A container-managed entity manager's lifecycle is managed
     by the Java EE container.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 The persistence context of container-managed entity managers propagate to
 other application components and their container-managed entity managers
 together with the active JTA transaction (independent of whether it was the
 container or the bean that started the transaction)<sup>4</sup>. But..
 
 Section "7.8.2 Container Managed Persistence Contexts":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     Exactly how the container maintains the association between persistence
     context and JTA transaction is not defined.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 The life cycles may either be controlled by the container or by application
 code. The entity manager is therefore said to be either a "container-managed
 entity manager" or an "application-managed entity manager".<p>
 
 For container-managed entity managers, then the container (= some server-side
 box you shouldn't need to care about) is the one that open/close the entity
 manager. Client code inject a container-managed entity manager using
 <code>@PersistenceContext</code>.<p>
 
 For application-managed entity managers, the client code is responsible for
 creating a <i>new</i> and opened entity manager using <code>EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager()</code>. These entity managers must be
 closed by the application using <code>EntityManager.close()</code>.<p>
 
 Application-managed entity managers has exactly one persistence context and
 that persistence context is not shared with other entity managers regardless
 of their type. The life cycle of a persistence context used by an
 application-managed entity manager is exactly the same as the life cycle of
 the entity manager. The life of the persistence context begin when client
 code call <code>EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager()</code> and the
 persistence context ends when client code call <code>EntityManager.close()</code>.
 Hence, application-managed entity managers can be viewed as <i>the</i>
 persistence context in use. Please read all about the details in
 <a href="../../../../../com/martinandersson/javaee/jpa/entitymanagers/applicationmanaged/JTATest.html" title="class in com.martinandersson.javaee.jpa.entitymanagers.applicationmanaged">JTATest</a>.<p>
 
 Too bad for us, the same is not true for container-managed entity
 managers.<p>
 
 
 
 <h3>The persistence context used by container-managed entity managers</h3>
 
 We shall look into persistence context propagation and its "scope" (i.e. life
 time) a bit closer in the following sections. For now, let's try to
 understand the relationship between container-managed entity managers and the
 persistence context that they use. The following discussion applies
 <strong>only</strong> to container-managed entity managers.<p>
 
 A persistence context may be associated with one or shared by many entity
 managers. The entity manager may be reused (pooled).<p>
 
 Section "7.6.4 Persistence Context Propagation":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     [..] a single persistence context may correspond to one or more JTA
     entity manager instances (all associated with the same entity manager
     factory).
 
 </code></pre>
 
 Section "7.8.2 Container Managed Persistence Contexts":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     [..] it is undefined whether a new entity manager instance is created for
     every persistence context, or whether entity manager instances are
     sometimes reused.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 Section "7.9.1 Container Responsibilities" (with note 86):
 
 <pre><code>
 
     The container creates a new entity manager by calling
     EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager when the first invocation of an
     entity manager with PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION occurs within the
     scope of a business method executing in the JTA transaction.
 
     After the JTA transaction has completed (either by transaction commit or
     rollback), the container closes the entity manager by calling
     EntityManager.close.
 
     The container may choose to pool EntityManagers: it instead of creating
     and closing in each case, it may acquire one from its pool and call
     clear() on it.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 Moral of the story is that the actual life cycle of the instance that is our
 API, the "entity manager", is not defined. Nor should we care. What we should
 <u>not</u> do is to invoke <code>EntityManager.close()</code> on a
 container-managed instance. It might be good to know that if you do that on a
 container-managed entity manager, then he will throw an <code>IllegalStateException</code>.<p>
 
 What about the life cycle of the persistence context?<p>
 
 Section "3.3. Persistence Context Lifetime and Synchronization Type":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     The lifetime of a container-managed persistence context can either be
     scoped to a transaction (transaction-scoped persistence context), or have
     a lifetime scope that extends beyond that of a single transaction
     (extended persistence context).
 
     [..]
 
     By default, the lifetime of the persistence context of a
     container-managed entity manager corresponds to the scope of a
     transaction [..].
 
     When an extended persistence context is used, the extended persistence
     context exists from the time the EntityManager instance is created until
     it is closed. This persistence context might span multiple transactions
     and non-transactional invocations of the EntityManager.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 
 Section "7.6. Container-managed Persistence Contexts":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     When a container-managed entity manager is used, the lifecycle of the
     persistence context is always managed automatically, transparently to the
     application [..].
 
 </code></pre>
 
 So it is pritty clear that the life cycle of the default transaction-scoped
 persistence context is the same as the transaction. We shall return to the
 "extended" persistence context in a subsequent section.<p>
 
 
 
 <h3>Obtaining a container-managed entity manager</h3>
 
 As will be evident when we talk about the entity manager factory, the entity
 manager and whatever persistence context he use, both of them are not thread
 safe and should not be invoked concurrently.<p>
 
 One must assume that if the provider's persistence context is not thread
 safe, then it is either 1) not shared by many entity managers or 2) access to
 the persistence context is synchronized.<p>
 
 The JPA specification does not restrict where an entity manager is used.<p>
 
 JPA 2.1, section "7.2.1. Obtaining an Entity Manager in the Java EE
 Environment":
 <pre><code>
 
     A container-managed entity manager is obtained by the application through
     dependency injection or through direct lookup of the entity manager in
     the JNDI namespace. The container manages the persistence context
     lifecycle and the creation and the closing of the entity manager instance
     transparently to the application.
 </code></pre>
 
 Nor does the umbrella specification restrict where an entity manager is used,
 as long as you inject the entity manager into a managed bean.<sup>5</sup><p>
 
 Java Platform, Enterprise Edition Specification v7 (JSR-342), section
 "EE.5.14.1.1 Injection of Persistence Context References":
 <pre><code>
 
     A field or a method of an application component may be annotated with the
     PersistenceContext annotation.
 </code></pre>
 
 Managed Beans 1.0 (JSR-316), section "MB.2.1.3 Lifecycle and Resource
 Injection":
 <pre><code>
 
     In a Java EE implementation, a Managed Bean may use any of the resource
     injection functionality laid out in Chapter EE.5 of the Java EE Platform
     specification, "Resources, Naming and Injection".
 </code></pre>
 
 The EJB specification allow all EJB:s to use a container-managed entity
 manager<sup>6</sup>. So from the application developer's perspective, he
 <i>should</i> not have to care and may inject the entity manager into a bean
 known by a Java EE container.<p>
 
 The entity manager has historically been something used on the inside of
 enterprise Java beans. These are thread safe unless a <code>@Singleton</code> has
 been configured differently. . The application developer can
 rest assured that whenever an entity manager is used by an EJB, he really
 should not worry about a thing. Let the container manage the entity manager,
 and you're all set.<p>
 
 About the same reasoning can be applied to entity managers injected into
 other thread safe things like a <code>@RequestScoped</code> CDI bean for
 example.<p>
 
 So what if we use CDI to lookup/produce the entity manager and slap a "CDI
 scope" on him? If we do, then we risk exposing the entity manager reference
 to many different threads. If we go one step further and try to close a
 container-managed entity manager in a disposer method, we violate the
 use contract and the entity manager will throw an <code>IllegalStateException</code>. In most cases, there is no point in using CDI to
 produce a container-managed entity manager. See
 <a href="../../../../../com/martinandersson/javaee/cdi/producers/entitymanager/package-summary.html">com.martinandersson.javaee.cdi.producers.entitymanager</a>.<p>
 
 In general, wherever we mutate JPA entities in a transaction-scoped
 persistence context, we need to have an active transaction going. Serious
 applications must handle transaction failures. EJB:s provide automatic
 transaction demarcation only (start and stop of a transaction). Same thing
 can be provided by a <code>@Transactional</code> CDI bean since Java EE 7. The
 only portable way an application has to figure out what the hell happened
 when a transaction fails, is to control the demarcation as well. The one
 reason left why you would prefer to only use entity managers inside
 <code>@Stateless</code> EJB:s is for thread safety and object pooling.<p>
 
 Thread-safety can be achieved by so many other means. To be a bit blunt, if
 one don't know shit about concurrent programming, then this guy shouldn't be
 writing code for back ends to begin with.<p>
 
 As far as object pooling goes, it is most likely that the component that
 deals with inbound requests to the Java EE application is throttled by means
 of a thread pool or a similar construct. Also, it is "typically"<sup>7</sup>
 the case that the database connections used is pooled as well. Overall, that
 should translate to a limited use case for <code>@Stateless</code> beans in your
 application. Why reduce the parallelism in your business layer if the layers
 on top and below yours are already throttled?<p>
 
 Therefore, use <code>@PersistenceContext</code> in whatever type of application
 components you have designated to handle persistence. Make sure you have a
 transaction whenever one is needed, and make sure the entity manager is not
 accessed concurrently.<p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Persistence context propagation and transaction type</h2>
 
 <strong>Propagation happens only for container-managed entity
 managers</strong>. The persistence context in application-managed entity
 managers is "stand-alone" and does not propagate anywhere, nor do an
 application-managed entity manager inherit a persistence context from someone
 else. For application-managed entity managers, it is application code that
 bear the responsibility of passing around the entity manager
 reference<sup>8</sup>.<p>
 
 Most likely, there is a persistence context associated with the entity
 manager. As the thread continuous his execution path into other components,
 the context may or may not be propagated to the entity managers used in these
 other components. Put in another way; one entity manager may inherit the
 persistence context of another. When this propagation occur, it will do so
 independent of how the "target" entity manager was injected; using
 <code>@PersistenceContext</code> or looked up programmatically with JNDI.<p>
 
 <strong>Container-managed entity managers can only use JTA
 transactions</strong> (JTA transactions will be briefly described a bit later
 in this document). <strong>Application-managed entity managers can use JTA,
 but has also the <i>option</i> to use resource-local transactions</strong>.
 Resource-local transactions involve only one entity manager and one resource
 (i.e. a database). The most common transaction type used is JTA
 transactions.<p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Scope of the persistence context</h2>
 
 The container-managed life cycle of the persistence context, is in most
 use-cases bound to the active JTA transaction.<p>
 
 As we learned a bit earlier in this document, application-managed entity
 managers have exactly one persistence context not shared by any one else.
 Hence, both of them are application-managed. Their life cycle can not be
 bound to the JTA transaction. If that was possible, then it would be the same
 as asking the container to manage an application-managed entity manager.
 Clearly, such a configuration wouldn't make much sense.<p>
 
 If the persistence context of a container-managed entity manager is bound to
 the JTA transaction, then the persistence context will be destroyed when the
 transaction commit. All managed entities in the persistence context will
 become detached. Thankfully, all entity changes are flushed/saved to the
 database before the entity become detached.<p>
 
 Alternatively, the persistence context may be <i>extended</i>. An extended
 persistence context "survive" the JTA transaction meaning that the entities
 in it will not become detached when the transaction commit. The application
 can even persist entities in this type of persistence context without an
 active transaction which is not possible in a JTA-bound persistence
 context.<p>
 
 The persistence context used by application-managed entity managers can only
 be extended. Container-managed entity managers has the option of choosing
 scope; JTA-bound or extended. If a container-managed entity manager want to
 use a persistence context with an extended scope, then that entity manager
 must only be used within a <code>@Stateful</code> EJB bean. The "extended scope"
 will become bound to the stateful's life cycle instead of a JTA transaction.
 JTA transactions may freely come and go during the life time of an extended
 persistence context. Read a bit more about extended persistence contexts in
 <a href="../../../../../com/martinandersson/javaee/jpa/entitymanagers/containermanaged/ExtendedTest.html" title="class in com.martinandersson.javaee.jpa.entitymanagers.containermanaged">ExtendedTest</a>.<p>
 
 <u>Summarization of this topic</u>: container-managed entity managers may be
 bound to the active JTA transaction or be extended. Application-managed
 entity managers can not be bound to a JTA transaction, their persistence
 contest is always extended.<p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Synchronization type and flush mode</h2>
 
 As if all the bloated talk this far wasn't enough, the persistence context
 can be synchronized or unsynchronized and use two different flush modes.
 Yaaay =)<p>
 
 Note that synchronizing a persistence context with a transaction is also
 called <i>joining</> the transaction.<p>
 
 Synchronization type and flush mode are for niche applications only and not
 further described in this document. If you want to know more, head over to
 the test files
 <a href="../../../../../com/martinandersson/javaee/jpa/entitymanagers/misc/QueryingForEntitiesTest.html" title="class in com.martinandersson.javaee.jpa.entitymanagers.misc">QueryingForEntitiesTest</a>
 and
 <a href="../../../../../com/martinandersson/javaee/jpa/entitymanagers/misc/SynchronizationTest.html" title="class in com.martinandersson.javaee.jpa.entitymanagers.misc">SynchronizationTest</a>.
 Suffice it is to say for now that by default, all entity managers that use
 JTA transactions are synchronized (meaning they won't cause you headache) and
 the flush mode of all entity managers is auto (also meaning your life will be
 better).<p>
 
 
 
 <h2>JTA Transactions</h2>
 
 JTA transactions are said to be "distributed" but that doesn't necessarily
 mean they are distributed across different machines and networks. JTA
 transactions are distributed in that multiple resources has registered their
 interest with the transaction manager to be part of the same transaction. For
 example a JMS queue and a JDBC compliant database driver. The resources
 might, and often do for home-built Java EE applications, reside on the same
 machine.<p>
 
 JTA transactions use the XA protocol, also known as "two-phase commit". Hence
 using JTA requires a XA compliant database driver to be setup in the data
 source definition (for a configuration example, see
 <a href="../../../../../com/martinandersson/javaee/resources/ArquillianDS.html" title="class in com.martinandersson.javaee.resources">ArquillianDS</a>).
 XA is quite expensive but modern Java EE servers may be able to optimize away
 the use of XA for a single resource (google "Logging Last Resource" and "Last
 Agent Optimization"). This kind of optimization is transparent for the
 application programmer. But the application programmer must specify a XA
 compliant database driver when using entity managers that in turn use JTA
 transactions.<p>
 
 Remember that container-managed entity managers which is the most common
 "type" of entity manager to use, must use JTA transactions.
 Application-managed entity managers can use JTA transactions, but they also
 have the option to use resource-local transactions. Resource-local
 transactions are not distributed. They involve only one single resource, the
 database.<p>
 
 Given modern optimizations, you should not choose to manage your own entity
 manager only for the unproved belief of a performance gain that
 resource-local transactions supposedly have over JTA. If you have the need
 for performance, then the single most important performance boost you can
 monetize is to not use transactions at all. All entity managers support
 issuing SELECT statements despite not being in an active transaction. See

 <h2>On transaction failure</h2>
 
 Section "3.3.3 Transaction Rollback":
 
 <pre><code>
 
     For both transaction-scoped persistence contexts and for extended
     persistence contexts that are joined to the current transaction,
     transaction rollback causes all pre-existing managed instances and
     removed instances to become detached. The instances' state will be the
     state of the instances at the point at which the transaction was rolled
     back. Transaction rollback typically causes the persistence context to be
     in an inconsistent state at the point of rollback. In particular, the
     state of version attributes and generated state (e.g., generated primary
     keys) may be inconsistent. Instances that were formerly managed by the
     persistence context (including new instances that were made persistent in
     that transaction) may therefore not be reusable in the same manner as
     other detached objects - for example, they may fail when passed to the
     merge operation.
 
     NOTE: Because a transaction-scoped persistence context’s lifetime is
     scoped to a transaction regardless of whether it is joined to that
     transaction, the container closes the persistence context upon
     transaction rollback. However, an extended persistence context that is
     not joined to a transaction is unaffected by transaction rollback.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 
 
 <h2>Entity Manager Factory</h2>
 
 The entity manager factory may be injected using <code>@PersistenceUnit</code> or
 using JNDI. The factory represents a JPA entity unit configuration as defined
 in the <code>persistence.xml</code> file. Applications mostly use
 container-managed entity managers and has no use of the entity manager
 factory.<p>
 
 As we learned previously, applications that want to use application-managed
 entity managers must use the factory method
 <code>EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager()</code> to actually get hold of an
 application-managed entity manager.<p>
 
 I said before that applications mostly use container managed entity managers
 and "has no use of the entity manager factory". Well, actually there is one
 use case. What if your bean used a container-managed entity manager that
 crashed the active transaction but the bean must for whatever reason call the
 database again with a query? The only plausible option you have is to create
 a new application-managed entity manager and issue the query. Using the
 container-managed entity manager again from the same bean will most likely
 fail when the entity manager discover that the transaction is a big failure
 and won't proceed.<p>
 
 Code that already have a reference to an entity manager may get the entity
 manager's factory using <code>EntityManager.getEntityManagerFactory()</code>.<p>
 
 Section "7.2 Obtaining an EntityManager":
 <pre><code>
 
     When container-managed entity managers are used (in Java EE
     environments), the application does not interact with the entity manager
     factory. The entity managers are obtained directly through dependency
     injection or from JNDI, and the container manages interaction with the
     entity manager factory transparently to the application. When
     application-managed entity managers are used, the application must use
     the entity manager factory to manage the entity manager and persistence
     context lifecycle.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 Noteworthy is section "7.6.4 Persistence Context Propagation":
 <pre><code>
 
     Entity manager instances obtained from different entity manager factories
     never share the same persistence context.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 
 
 <h2>Life cycle of an entity manager factory</h2>
 
 Section "7.3 Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory" says (this quote begin with
 the footnote in the section):
 <pre><code>
 
     There is only one entity manager factory per persistence unit[.]
     
     [..]
 
     More than one entity manager factory instance may be available
     simultaneously in the JVM.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 There may only be more than one factory available if there is more than one
 persistence unit defined in the <code>persistence.xml</code> file.<p>
 
 Section "7.4 EntityManagerFactory Interface":
 <pre><code>
 
     The EntityManagerFactory interface is used by the application to obtain an
     application-managed entity manager. When the application has finished
     using the entity manager factory, and/or at application shutdown, the
     application should close the entity manager factory. Once an entity
     manager factory has been closed, all its entity managers are considered to
     be in the closed state.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 The specification doesn't say when the server open or close an entity manager
 factory. Only when speaking of third party factories do section
 "7.8.1 Application-managed Persistence Contexts" say that:
 <pre><code>
 
     [..] the container is required to support third-party persistence
     providers, and in this case the container must use the
     PersistenceProvider.createContainerEntityManagerFactory method to create
     the entity manager factory and the EntityManagerFactory.close method to
     destroy the entity manager factory prior to shutdown (if it has not been
     previously closed by the application).
 
 </code></pre>
 
 As a conclusion, application code must never bother about opening a factory.
 That is handled by the provider. Likewise, application code <i>should</i>
 never bother to close the entity manager factory either.<p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Threading model</h2>
 
 Section "7.2 Obtaining an EntityManager":
 <pre><code>
 
     An entity manager must not be shared among multiple concurrently
     executing threads, as the entity manager and persistence context are not
     required to be threadsafe. Entity managers must only be accessed in a
     single-threaded manner.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 Using container-managed entity managers in EJB:s that serialize their calls
 (except a non-default configured <code>@Singleton</code>) translates to a
 trouble free application. This is the most used setup so - no worries.<p>
 
 If you do use the entity manager factory, then you're safe as well. Section
 7.3 Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory:
 
 <pre><code>
 
     Methods of the EntityManagerFactory interface are threadsafe.
 
 </code></pre>
 
 
 
 <h4>Note 1</h4>
 
 Even managed entities may loose changes if they were modified outside a
 transaction and the persistence context that they belong to never joined a
 transaction after the modification. See

 <h4>Note 4</h4>
 
 There is an exception to this rule. A <code>@Stateful</code> bean that uses an
 extended persistence context cannot be the target of such a propagation.
